This Perl script parses Synopsys man pages to generate a Tcl-compatible syntax
file for vim.

## Details

Based on the [Synopsys](http://www.synopsys.com) man pages for one or more of
these tools installed on your system:

* Design Compiler,
* IC Compiler,
* Formality, or
* PrimeTime,

this Perl script will generate a single synopsys.vim syntax file for
[Vim](http://www.vim.org), which can be used in combination with the standard
Tcl syntax file, i.e. tcl.vim.

Only the script commands in the preformatted 'cat2' category are parsed. Syntax
codes are generated for the command names as well as their options.

Given that man pages follow familiar rules, this script may also be used for
other Synopsys tools, but it has only been tested for the tools listed above.

Other, pre-compiled .vim syntax files exist, but most are out-of-date. With
snpsMan2VimSyntax, you can generate a syntax file that _exactly_ matches the
tool(s) that are installed on your system.


## Using the Script

You need the Synopsys tools installed on your system. Begin by adding their
$SYNOPSYS/bin paths to your $PATH. This is necessary such that the script
can locate the executables, e.g. `dc_shell`, from which the man paths can be
derived. Then run:

	snpsMan2VimSyntax --verbose

This will search for the install paths of DC, FM, and PT (which may well be
installed in separate directories), locate the man pages, and generate a
synopsys.vim file. If you like, you can use a selected subset of the tools:

	snpsMan2VimSyntax --verbose --tool dc --tool icc

For help and additional options, use:

	snpsMan2VimSyntax --help


## tcl.vim Version Support

Two distinct tcl.vim syntax definitions exist:

*   The standard [tcl.vim](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/runtime/syntax/tcl.vim)
    file, maintained by Taylor Venable, which is pre-installed with vim-7.x;

*   The optional [tcl.vim on www.vim.org](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script_search_results.php?keywords=tcl&script_type=syntax&order_by=downloads&direction=descending&search=search)
    script, maintained by SM Smithfield. To support this version, please add
    the --old-tcl-vim option:

            snpsMan2VimSyntax --verbose --old-tcl-vim


## Installing the Syntax File

The aim is not to replace the tcl.vim file that already exists on your
system. Instead, the synopsys.vim file is used to extend the Tcl syntax
definitions. To do this, place the file here:

	~/.vim/syntax/synopsys.vim

Next, create this add-on Tcl syntax definition file:

	~/.vim/syntax/after/tcl.vim

and edit it to contain:

```tcl
" Vim syntax file
" This file is loaded AFTER the standard tcl.vim file.

" Include the Synopsys commands.
source ~/.vim/syntax/synopsys.vim

" Additional syntax definitions:

```

Now open one of your Tcl scripts in `vim` and make sure you use `:syntax on`
and `:set syntax=tcl`.


## Requirements

* The Synopsys tools need to be installed.

* The script uses `man` to parse the man pages
  and `col` to remove colour codes.

* To auto-detect standard Tcl commands, a stand-alone Tcl installation is
  needed. To check, see if `tclsh` is available. Or try `man tclvars`.
  If not installed, you can run snpsMan2VimSyntax with the --tcl option.

* The syntax files have been tested with vim 7.3.

* If you used the non-standard version of the tcl.vim syntax file, i.e.
  one written by SM Smithfield (see its header), use the --old-tcl-vim
  option to generate the syntax definitions.
